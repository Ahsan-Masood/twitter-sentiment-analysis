1. Check for all the python dependencies and libraries, moreover activate your XAMPP/WampServer before executing the source files.

2. Place the "Server Side" folder contents into XAMPP's "htdocs" folder. Or if you are using WampServer then place them into "www" folder.

3. Run the SA.py file from "Python Side" folder, using terminal. (You do not have to run any other file, it would do all the work itself).
